Episode 5 - Lets get hooked

Two types of export - 1) Default export => export default compName , to Import => import component from 'Path'
2) Named export => export const component; To Import => import {component} from "Path".

Q) Is it possible to do both kind of export in a single file. 
Q) Hooks - Normal JS utility function written by fb devs. Two very important hooks 1) useState() 2) useEffect() --> contd 1:29mins apply bnp paribas
q) Whenever a state variable changes, the react will re-render the component. (Time: 1:41 -> to see the modified code
Q) React fibre algorithm(check github link), React conciallation

Episode 6 - Exploring the world
q) Monolith architecture - Having all the service like api,ui, db, auth, message service in a single project is called monolith architecture.
q) Microservice architecture - Different services for different jobs, All the service like above forms a app. It forms a single responsibility and each service
doesn't interfere.  Ex: namaste react is a UI service. In this case, seaprate lang can be used in each service, ui in js api in java. They run on different
ports. Ports can be mapped.
q) Two Approaches how UI fetches the data from backend
First approach : Load the page, send the api and wait for the api's to complete and then load the page. Till api is finished the UI doesn't show anything.
Second Approach: Load the page, render the skelton --> fire the apis --> Again re-render it. In react this approach is followed vivdly. React 
renders fastly so it does not cause any issues. It gives a better UX experience. 

q) UseEffect - it has 2 arguments, first is a callback function and second is dependency array. Import this as named variable. The callback  will be called 
as soon as the render cycle is finished. 
q) Optional chaining -learn more.
q) Shimmer UI - loading the fake page until the actual page is loaded.
q) Why do we use useState method? - The reason is if we want to have a local variable and change dynamically like login-logout example of a same button,
the we have to use the useState method. For dynamic purpose the concept is used. Syntax => const[a,b] =useState(""), here a is the variable and b is the
function which is used to change the a's value. We cannot directly modify the a value, we have to use a function to modify.
q) why react is faster? - react fibre finds the difference between the two virtual doms and updates only which is necessary.


Episode - 7 - Finding the Path
---------------------------------

q) When is useEffect is called?
If no dependency array called => useEffect is called on every render
If dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called initial render(just once)
If dependency array is [btnReact] => useEffect is called on every update of btnReact.

q) Best practice of useState.
UseState should be called on top of the function.
do not use useState in the if else statement, for loops or conditions

q) npm package for routing
react router dom - npm i react-router-dom
q) children routes - outlet
based on the path, the outlet will call the corresponding page and it is not seen in html.
q) Link is a super component provided by the react router dom. It will not reload the page only the content is changed.
Two kind of routing :
Client side routing - It does not make network calls, all the needed items are rendered priorly.
Server side routing - It makes the network calls. 
q) :resId --> This means that this part of url is dynamic.


Part 8 - Class based components
q) It is a older way of writing code. New way is functional components. 
q) What is class based components - It is a normal javascript class.
q) What is react.component - It is class given by the react so that the class can inherit properties from this. This react.component comes from react so we need to import it.
q) Loading a class based component means creating a instance of the class.
q) UseState in the class component should be used where instance of the class is created. So it must be used in the constructor function.
q) "this.state " to create state variable in the class based component, here state is the reserved word.
q) Never update state variables directly.
q) class component has two methods : render and componentDidMount(). First class constructor is called, second: render method and finally: componentDidMount method is called.
q) Api call will be inside the componentDidMount() method. It is because, first the UI should be rendered then the api call should happen, else the UI will wait 
till the api is executed. 1:07:00 to 1:10:00 & 1:20 to 1:30 (to know why react is fast and lifecycle of class components)
q) React does the render phase first and commit phase later.
q) If there are two or more child classes defined the parent class component then, the process is parent constructor -> parent render --> childA constructor
--> childA render --> childB constructor --> childB render --> childA'scomponentDidMount --> childB'sComponentDidMount --> Parent's componentDidMount.
q) ComponentDidUpdate calls finally. From 2:00 to 2:40 (live class, check it out later).


Part 9 - Optimizing the App
q) Creating custom hooks - time :44:50
q) chunking, code-splitting - breaking down the application instead of loading the application into single js file. 
q) lazy loading = we will not load directly, we will load only after it is called. It is also called as on-demand loading.
q) Suspense - because of lazy loading, on clicking the componenet, the react will take few seconds to load the page, in between the time, the react will try to 
render the components but it fails, so it thows an error. To avoid this error we can use suspense method to delay the react rendering. We have to wrap the 
componenet with suspense attribue. <suspense><grocery></suspense>.


Part 10- jo dikta hai ho biktha nahi
q) Sass - css - scss - ant UI - chakra UI - material UI- most popular css frameworks.
q) Tailwind css. Install tailwind css using parcel
q) After installing the tailwind css, it will create a config file for tailwind css. we have to creae postccs files.
q) Install tailwind intellisense in the vs code extension.
q) Tailwind css is lightweight. If we have m4(margin) used in many places, while bundling only one m4 class is used. Repeatition is not allowed.
